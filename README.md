# sql-challenge
Module 9 challenge assignment

The code for this assignment was entirely my own, however I did compare my ERD with another
classmate's (Kathryn) before actually building the .sql files. I wanted to ensure that I was on the right track before potentially wasting a bunch of time on something with an incorrect foundation. 

I also used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help clarify my understanding of the proper way to relate tables to each other and the structure of foreign keys.

For any syntax issues I was having, I simply referred to the in-class exercises.
